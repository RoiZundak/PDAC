    Hi,

    For loading the project please work inside platform(NOT NOTEPAD++) you need localhost OR
    load the project to a external web(I worked with 'WebStorm'),Yoy can also work with Git.
    This is not my request-It's from Google.
    all of this because the XML request in getSelectedFileContent function-> 'GET'.


    First I will start with thank you, this exercise make me learn all about google maps API,now  I have a lot of knowledge.
    I start on wednesday and it take me an half hour to build the page.
    after I finish with that I learned all about this API I read from google developers.(work time:several hours learning)
    In the start the biggest problem that I handle with it was to connect your KML file to my page,
    I connect other external kml file from Google but the localhost file didn't works,I read more and I found that I need to upload the file
    online(request from Google),I tried from my Google Drive-didn't work than I tried from 'google developers storage' and
    also got 'INVALID REQUEST' or others error all of this was because all cloud platform read the file in JS not in KML.
    Finally I tried from 'Github' and it works properly.(work time:day work)

    When I finished with all the administrative stuff I start to work on the logic side, Got input from user(lat,lan):
    I got the KML file and find his Coordinates (Parse the KML),and got array of all his coordinates.
    Then I did a lot of mathematical ways to calculate the distance.
    Best point that closest to my Poly,than take the second and create triangle between them,then I used
    'Pythagoras sentence'(sqrt of the square of distance between points) to find the shortest way to the Poly
    and that is the point that i struggled,the mathematical idea was OK but something dose'nt work well.
    (work time:2 days ...)
    I didn't succeed all you asked from me, it was big challenge for me.
    I hope that all I did stands with your standards.

    BR,
    Roi Cohen.
